# How to submit a talk to BerlinJS?

Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/berlinjs/berlinjs.org/issues/new)
on this repo. You can also get in touch via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/berlinjs),
[Slack](https://berlinjs-slack.herokuapp.com), or send us an
e-mail to submit[at]berlinjs.org. We try to consider all talk proposals as
they come in. Sometimes a talk might better fit in a different edition of the
meetup. Please understand that â€” sometimes â€” we might also decide a specific
topic isn't a good fit.

We are looking forward to all your submissions!

### What should I talk about?

Anything JavaScript (JavaScript / JavaScript community related), that gets you
excited.

### Do I need to be an expert to talk?

Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to
participate. We especially encourage people of underrepresented groups to apply.

### How long should my talk be?

Between five and twentyfive minutes. There wonâ€™t be any formal Q&A.

### What should be in my talk submission?

Our issue template will help you answer that question. ðŸ˜‰

### What's the A/V situation?

We'll have a projector (Full HD / HDMI) and a mic for you to use. Adapters
are available.
