                <p>
                  No matter what I tried, for years it seemed that there was nothing to get me out of bed in the morning.
                  After having almost given up, one day I realized that node.js was the answer to all my troubles.

                  <h3>AppTorrent: an experiment in hash-hosting of html5 apps</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Unhosted project defines a standard for cross-origin storage of user data. The idea is quite simple:
                    write your html5 app without the ajax-backend. Write only the app. Then, the domain where that user's data
                    is stored is discovered based on the user address (user@host) with which the user logs in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the need to store user data disappears, the html5 app itself is reduced to a 100% client-side affair.
                    In other words, it is flattened to static content. The idea behind AppTorrent is that packaged static content
                    can be moved around. As long as you don't serve more than one app per port to each client, javascript
                    sandboxing is preserved. And because the app's URL is now &lt;hash&gt;.apptorrent.net, you can easily
                    fork the app, and republish a patched version of it.

                  <p>
                    Data.js tries to provide an API on top of graph data, that makes it easy to access and group data into

                    domain knowledge) reuse. Data.js features a query interface, data-transformations (like clustering),
                    validations, realtime updates as well as a CouchDB backend for persistence.

                  <h3>Common Node &mdash; A CommonJS compatibility layer for Node.js</h3>
                  <p>
                    Node.js has captured the attention of early adopters by clearly differentiating itself as being
                    asynchronous from the ground up. Now that server side JavaScript is at the cutting edge of the
                    asynchronous, real time web, it is in a much better position to establish itself as the go to language for
                    synchronous CRUD webapps and gain a stronger foothold on the server.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The talk will cover the current state of server side JavaScript beyond Node by mapping out the key
                    standards &amp; technologies and their respective positions in the stack. It will introduce
                    <a href="http://olegp.github.com/common-node/" title="Common Node">Common Node</a>, a synchronous CommonJS
                    compatibility layer using node-fibers which bridges the gap between the different platforms. We'll look
                    intoCommon Node's internals, compare its performance to that of other implementations such as RingoJS and
                    go through some ideal use cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A case will be made for a cross platform, synchronous, Rails like framework. In conclusion, we will try to
                    identify new areas where server side JavaScript could really shine, including API mashups, collaborative
                    development and crowd sourced functionality.

                  <p>
                    Closures, 'this', call and apply are hard topics to grasp for newcomers to JavaScript.

                  <p>
                    In this talk I will try to explain (with illustrations) what closures are, what 'this' is and how it
                    relates to closures, how callbacks can be confusing and how confusion can be avoided.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once you're comfortable and think you've understood 'this', I'll throw call and apply at you. When we
                    emerge on the other side, there will be unicorns and pixie dust :)

                  <p>
                    Tales of adventures using server side jquery and json instead of a templating language.  How server side
                    jquery works, and why server side jquery is useful.  Benchmark results comparing this technique to other
                    templating systems. Finally a discussion on how to integrate it with other systems.

                  <h3>The future is Realtime</h3>
                  <p>
                    Over the last decade, we've seen a dramatic shift in the way
                    that the web is used. Now, we have more content generated by
                    everyday users than ever before — and that's an exponential
                    increase. We now know thanks to a lot of research that time
                    definitely does equal money, in more ways than one. Initially it
                    was just a reference to developer or human time, then a
                    reference to the page-load speed affecting sales, now we're
                    moving rapidly towards a web where users want to be able to
                    share and communicate in closer to realtime than ever before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the past, we've tried to hack together functionality for
                    this, which worked reasonably well, but now we have WebSockets
                    and platforms like Node.js, which make the realtime web ever
                    more accessible to developers. As the public consumption of the
                    realtime web increases, so will users expectations of how
                    quickly things should happen on the web.
